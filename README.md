# LExCI 2

The **L**earning and **Ex**periencing **C**ycle **I**nterface (LExCI) is a
framework for reinforcement learning (RL) with embedded systems. It bridges the
gap between established, traditional RL-libraries and embedded devices with
their inherent limitations and unique requirements. Specifically, it utilises
[Ray/RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for training agents and
[TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)/[TensorFlow Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro)
to model their neural networks.

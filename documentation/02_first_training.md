# First Training

Whether you want to familiarise yourself with LExCI or you need to verify that
everything went smoothly during installation, the pendulum swing-up problem is a
great place to start. It's the environment that was tackled in the
[LExCI paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-024-05573-0) and,
as such, it naturally comes with pre-configured hyperparameter sets as well as
an implementation of the Minion. All you need to do is to generate a
configuration file, start the Master and the Minion, and wait until the agent
converges. This document will show you how.
